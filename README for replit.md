### Credits
LabSim was originally made as a collection of existing Sandboxels mod called Proboxels. Later, a mod named Turtleguineapigs was fully merged into Proboxels. The creators of Turtleguineapigs joined Aeonic, then known as E11. They came up with the name LabSim, and designed the original logo.
The creators of LabSim shall give credit to R74n, the original creator of Sandboxels. LabSim is a fork of Sandboxels version 1.4.
